## <a id="id_1" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Change to licensing model

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The licensing model for Katalon Studio Enterprise (KSE) and Katalon Runtime Engine (KRE) is changing. KSE node-locked and floating license types as well as KRE node-locked license types are being deprecated. The licensing model for both products is transitioning to the following:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">KSE node-locked and floating license → KSE per-User license</li><li className="li">KRE node-locked and floating license → KRE floating license</li></ul>

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="sectiondiv"><strong className="ph b">Node-Locked License</strong><p className="p">This license type is applied to local desktops or workstations with fixed hardware specifications (machine-blocked license), such as:</p><ul className="ul"><li className="li">A virtual machine with a fixed machine ID</li><li className="li">A physical machine</li></ul><p className="p">With node-locked licenses, one machine running tests = one license.</p><ul className="ul"><li className="li">A license is tied to a single machine ID and only for one execution session at a time.</li><li className="li">A machine can be mapped to multiple licenses if needed.</li><li className="li">For machines connected to the internet, the licenses can be transferred to other machines at no cost and as many times as needed.</li><li className="li">For <em className="ph i">annual licenses</em> only: Licenses can be converted to be used in an offline environment. Once converted, the license cannot be transferred to another machine until it is expired.</li><li className="li">Licenses purchased on a monthly basis cannot be converted for use in an offline environment.</li></ul></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="sectiondiv"><strong className="ph b">Floating License</strong><p className="p">For scaling teams with dynamic usage, floating licenses reduce the management cost and optimize your workflow.</p><p className="p">This license type is applied to all types of execution environments, including cloud or virtual machines with dynamic hardware specifications (to execute tests in Docker, Azure, AWS).</p><ul className="ul"><li className="li">One floating license can be shared across a maximum of 3 machines.</li><li className="li">One floating license is assigned to one execution session at a time.</li></ul><p className="p">For instance, you have 1 floating Katalon Studio Enterprise license attached to the email <a className="xref j-external-link" href="mailto:example@katalon.com" target="_blank">example@katalon.com</a>.</p><p className="p">You can use <a className="xref j-external-link" href="mailto:example@katalon.com" target="_blank">example@katalon.com</a> to log in to Katalon Studio on up to 3 different machines, but not at the same time. This is because <a className="xref j-external-link" href="mailto:example@katalon.com" target="_blank">example@katalon.com</a> represents only 1 floating Katalon Studio Enterprise license. Therefore, you can only be active on 1 of those 3 machines at a time.</p></div>

## <a id="id_3" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Technical support for annual or multi-year contract

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">If you currently have an annual or multi-year contract, deprecating license types will continue to function as expected until the end of your current contract. Once that contract ends, only new license types will be available for use.</p> 
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="note note note_note"><span className="note__title">Note:</span> 
  <ul className="ul"><li className="li">For KSE, floating and node-locked licenses cannot co-exist with
      per-User licenses. You cannot directly purchase per-User licenses
      until your contract expires or you decide to transition to the new
      license model. You can contact the Success team at
      success@katalon.com, if you want to immediately convert to the
      per-User licensing model.</li></ul></div>

## <a id="concept-7157" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Migration mapping of KSE floating/node-locked to KSE per-User licenses

      

### <a id="id_5" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Case 1: Automatic transition to KSE per-User licenses

      
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">This case applies to those of you whose license renewal date is   due, and happens automatically.</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Consider a scenario where you are a group of 5 users. You have   the following licenses at your disposal:</p> 
        
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">1 generated Offline floating license.</li>   <li className="li">3 floating licenses.</li> </ul> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">As you can see above, the number of people in your group (5   users) is more than the number of licenses itself (3 floating   licenses). Thus, when the license renewal date approaches, 3 KSE   per-User licenses are issued to your group, based on the following   order of priority:</p> 
        
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul">   <li className="li">1 user who has an Offline floating license.</li>   <li className="li">2 unique users who are last seen active.</li> </ul> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Thus, you can say:</p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   <em className="ph i">N Offline licenses + O unique last active users = P     licenses</em> </p> 
        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In general, if you have 1,3,4,5……n KSE floating   licenses, an equivalent number of last active users receive   corresponding per-User licenses.</p> 
      
    

### <a id="id_6" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Case 2: Manual transition to KSE per-User licenses

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">This case applies to those who wish to upgrade Katalon licenses or switch to the KSE per-User licenses while the license renewal date is not due.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Consider a scenario where you are a group of 5 users and wish to transition to per-User licenses. To do this:</p> 
<ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ol"><li className="li"><p className="p">Go to the <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://www.katalon.com/pricing/" target="_blank">Katalon Pricing</a> page, select <strong className="ph b">Katalon Studio</strong>, on the KSE per-User plan, click <strong className="ph b">Buy now</strong>.</p>     <p className="p">Alternatively, you can sign in to <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://testops.katalon.io/login" target="_blank">Katalon TestOps</a>, then go to <strong className="ph b">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong className="ph b">Subscription Management</strong>, select <strong className="ph b">Katalon Studio</strong>, and click <strong className="ph b">Subscribe</strong> on the KSE per-User plan.</p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">By doing so, you are prompted to confirm whether you wish to merge your existing floating/node-locked licenses to new per-User licenses.</p></li></ol> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Once you confirm your interest for the transition to per-User licenses, the licenses are assigned to you on order of priority, as it was during automatic renewal.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In case you want to upgrade your plan, after finishing the transition, log into <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://testops.katalon.io/" target="_blank">Katalon TestOps</a> to upgrade your plan.

## <a id="concept-7960" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Migration mapping of KRE floating/node-locked to KRE floating licenses

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Depending on the KRE licenses you currently have, the following cases apply.</p> 

### Case 1: Users with monthly KRE node-locked licenses only

                        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can still use your existing KRE node-locked licenses until their renewal date, but you cannot purchase more. If the renewal date is after June 7th, KRE node-locked licenses will be converted into KRE floating licenses.</p> 
            
<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">If you do not cancel the monthly KRE node-locked licenses, they are automatically renewed and converted into monthly KRE floating licenses after June 7th. You then can upgrade the number of monthly KRE floating licenses.<div className="note note note_note"><span className="note__title">Note:</span> 
    <ul className="ul"><li className="li">Make sure you cancel KRE node-locked subscriptions before subscribing to the new KRE floating licenses to avoid additional charges.</li></ul>
  </div></div>
        

### Case 2: Users with KRE node-locked and KRE floating licenses

                        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can still use the current KRE node-locked licenses until their renewal date, but you cannot purchase more.</p> 
            
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">If you do not cancel the KRE node-locked licenses, they are automatically renewed and converted into KRE floating licenses after June 7th. For example, you have 2 KRE node-locked and 3 KRE floating licenses. If you do not cancel the KRE node-locked subscription, your KRE node-locked licenses will be renewed automatically after June 7th and become KRE floating licenses. You then have a total of 5 KRE floating licenses from June 8th.</p> 
            
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can upgrade KRE floating licenses normally.</p> 
        

### Case 3: Users with KRE floating licenses only

                        
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">You can upgrade KRE floating licenses normally.</p>
