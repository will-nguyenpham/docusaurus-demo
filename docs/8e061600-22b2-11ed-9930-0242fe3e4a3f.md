## Overview

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The <span className="ph uicontrol">Requirement Coverage</span> report allows you to monitor the coverage of test cases and test runs in each corresponding requirement in your project.</p>

## Insights

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Project management with Jira/Cucumber integration could not be effective if it does not allow you to centralize all Jira and BDD requirements in one single place for reports and analytics.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The larger a project is, the more requirements you and your team have to ensure all defects and product components are covered within the project. It also means a strong need for a heatmap incorporating all requirements while showing their statuses visibly in one central location.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In Katalon TestOps, the <span className="ph uicontrol">Requirement Coverage</span> report serves that purpose.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">With one glance at the dashboard, you and your team can see a comprehensive report of your production progress, quickly spotting the requirements that need a close-up attention.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">For example, if the report is represented as follows:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">One green rectangle represents the coverage of "Requirement 1".</li><li className="li">One orange rectangle represents the coverage of "Requirement 2".</li><li className="li">The size of the green rectangle is bigger than the orange one.</li></ul> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The analytics offer the following information:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">There is more coverage of test cases and test runs on "Requirement 1" than "Requirement 2".</li><li className="li">The quality of test cases on "Requirement 1" is better than that of "Requirement 2".</li><li className="li">The green color means that tests are passed, while the orange color represents failed tests. If a green rectangle is bigger than the orange one, it is a good sign. By contrast, if the orange rectangle is bigger, it signifies that there is a lot of bugs and the product is not working as expected.</li></ul>
