<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p"><span className="ph">Katalon Studio</span> integrates with <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://www.wiremock.io/?utm_source=katalon&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=partnership-blog" target="_blank">WireMock</a>, a leading provider of mocking services that delivers both an open source version as well as a cloud version. With <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://www.wiremock.io/?utm_source=katalon&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=partnership-blog" target="_blank">WireMock Cloud</a>, Katalon users will be able to easily mimic a production API's behavior for end to end testing even if the production API is not yet developed or available. These virtualized services (otherwise known as service virtualization) can then be shared and used across teams without additional effort or maintenance.</p>

<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">to build test assets even when the APIs you need aren't ready or released.</li><li className="li">to guard against unstable 3rd party API's when developing tests to reduce test flakiness</li><li className="li">to simulate edge cases and faults easily, to help with unhappy path testing.</li></ul>

<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="section context">To integrate Katalon Studio with WireMock Cloud, you need to follow these steps: <ul className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p">WireMock Cloud offers a free forever edition as well as paid plans for enterprises. You will need to <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://www.wiremock.io/?utm_source=katalon&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=partnership-blog" target="_blank">create a WireMock Cloud</a> account to leverage WireMock with Katalon.  </p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">Verify the response of the WireMock API: In your Katalon test script, you need to verify the response of the WireMocked API to ensure that it meets your expectations.   </p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">You can do this by using the API testing and Verification Validation mechanisms to check the status code, headers, and response body of the HTTP response.  </p></li><li className="li"><p className="p">Call the WireMocked API in your test: In your Katalon test script, you need to call the WireMocked API to verify the behavior of your system under test. You can do this by making HTTP requests using the WebUI.callRestApi method in Katalon.</p></li></ul> </section>
