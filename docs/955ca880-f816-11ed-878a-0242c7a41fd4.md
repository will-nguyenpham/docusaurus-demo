## Where is the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ph">TestOps</span>  cloud hosted?

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The <span className="ph">TestOps</span> application and its data are both hosted on AWS in the <code className="ph codeph">us-east-1 region</code> (Northern Virginia, USA).</p> 

## What port does <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ph">Katalon Studio</span>  use to communicate with external resources?

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p"><span className="ph">Katalon Studio</span> is a desktop application and it has connections to ALM integration servers such as JIRA, qTest, Slack, CI whose security protocols are configured by the users. <span className="ph">Katalon Studio</span> uses port 443 for updating checking/ bugs reporting.</p> 

## How configuration and credential data be encrypted in Katalon Studio?

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">   App configurations and credential data will be encrypted by PBE with SHA1 and DESede.</p> 

## What type of encryption does the 'Encrypt Text' tool in Katalon Studio use?

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p"> </p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">We use <a className="xref j-external-link" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html" target="_blank">PBEwithSHA1AndDESede</a> algorithm. Katalon Studio will keep a unique salt and secret key to encrypt and decrypt values when performing the keyword action. We provide only the encryption feature without the decryption feature. Users can only see the encrypted value in the script file. The raw value will not be logged in our report. You can encrypt text manually by going to Katalon Studio, <span className="ph menucascade"><span className="ph uicontrol">Help</span><abbr title="and then"> &gt; </abbr><span className="ph uicontrol">Encrypt Text</span></span>:<img className="image" src={useBaseUrl("/95664570-f816-11ed-878a-0242c7a41fd4.jpeg")} alt="Katalon Studio encrypt text" />The encrypted value can be used in the method:</p> 
    
<pre xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="pre codeblock"><code>WebUI.setEncryptedText(findTestObject(null), '8SQVv/p9jVTHLrggi8kCzw=='){"\n"}</code></pre> 
    
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">The method is to fill the encrypted text into a text box, the raw value will be decrypted when running the test.</p> 

## How does Katalon manage the physical security setup of the system/service (including overview/architecture drawing)?

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Katalon security framework complies with the <strong className="ph b">ISO/IEC 27001 standard</strong> for information security management system (ISMS) and covers Physical and Environmental security to prevent unauthorized physical access, damage, and interference to the organization's information and information processing facilities. <img className="image" src={useBaseUrl("/956d9870-f816-11ed-878a-0242c7a41fd4.jpeg")} alt="ISO standard - physical and environmental security" /></p> 

## Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) - General update

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">On the 9th of December 2021, a Remote Code Execution exploit CVE-2021-44228 was discovered in a popular Java logging library called Log4j2. It became widespread and known to have been exploited in the wild. This incident was created for further investigation and response to fully understand and respond to the potential attacks on Katalon assets. Based on our internal review, Katalon users are not affected by this vulnerability.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p"><span className="ph">Katalon TestOps</span> is not affected by this vulnerability. TestOps uses the default implementation of Spring Boot (implemented Logback through SLF4J for logging). As noted by the Spring Boot team: "Spring Boot users are only affected by this vulnerability if they have switched the default logging system to Log4J2."</p> 
    
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Any vulnerability that might exist in TestOps has been mitigated to some extent in its Web Application Firewall (WAF) controls, which have been updated to block requests embedding known attacks on this vulnerability.</p> 
    
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">As of 13 December 2021, TestOps has been upgraded to include Log4J v2.15.0 in its dependencies. In combination with the WAF controls noted above, these corrective actions should completely mitigate any exposure in TestOps.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p"><span className="ph">Katalon Studio Enterprise</span> uses Log4J v1.2.15. This version is not as vulnerable as the version identified in the CVE, particularly given that we are not using the JMSAppender. The similar conclusion is drawn for <span className="ph">Katalon Runtime Engine</span>.</p>
