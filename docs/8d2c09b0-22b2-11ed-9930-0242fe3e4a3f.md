## <a id="id_1" class="anchor_top_offset"/>How it works

<div xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="note important note_important"><span className="note__title">Important:</span> 
  <ul className="ul"><li className="li">Katalon Studio version 8.0 onwards</li><li className="li">Katalon Runtime Engine</li><li className="li">Agent version 1.7.0 onwards</li><li className="li">At least 2 active Agents</li></ul>
</div>
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In Katalon TestOps, you can execute tests in parallel. During   parallel execution, Test Runs are automatically load-balanced. This   means that each time a Test Run starts, the Test Run is distributed   to an available and active local test environment, minimizing   execution time.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">When a Test Run is executed, the test sessions will be assigned   to the previously configured Agents in this order of priority:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">Idle Agents</li><li className="li">Agents that have not exceeded their Threshold</li><li className="li">Agents with the least number of queued Test Runs</li></ul> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">When an Agent completes a Test Run session, queued jobs that   were first assigned to other Agents can be automatically reassigned   to this Agent for immediate execution.</p> 

## <a id="id_2" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Configure Auto-Distributed Executions

<ol xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ol"><li className="li">     <p className="p">To enable Auto-Distributed Executions, make sure that you have       at least 2 active Agents. You can learn how to set-up Agents here:       <a className="xref" href="/docs/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/create-a-local-test-environment-with-an-agent">Create         a Local Test Environment</a>.</p>   </li><li className="li">     <p className="p">Make sure that your Test Suite Collection is configured for       parallel execution. If not, you can follow these steps: <a className="xref" href="/docs/execute/cloud-based-test-execution/test-execution-with-testops/local-test-environments/run-multiple-test-suites-in-parallel-with-agents">Run         multiple Test Suites in Parallel</a>.</p>   </li><li className="li">     <p className="p">Create a Test Schedule and assign your Test Run Types to those       Agents. Learn more: <a className="xref" href="/docs/execute/schedule-test-execution/schedule-test-runs-in-testops#task-7544">Schedule         Test Runs</a>.</p>     <div className="note tip note_tip"><span className="note__title">Tip:</span>        <ul className="ul"><li className="li"><p className="p">When configuring multiple Test Run Types, Test Run Types must             share a minimum of 1 mutual Agent for distributed execution. In             other words, assign Test Run Types to multiple, overlapping             Agents.</p></li></ul>     </div></li><li className="li">     <p className="p">Activate your Agents before the scheduled Test Run time.</p>   </li><li className="li"><p className="p">Once the Test Run Types execute, the test sessions of these Test       Run Types are assigned to the previously configured agents       automatically.</p></li></ol>
