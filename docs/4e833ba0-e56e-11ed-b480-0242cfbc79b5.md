<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="shortdesc">A draft test case is a test case that has been created but has not yet been reviewed or approved publicly in an Organization. It is a work-in-progress and may be subject to changes before it is finalized. </p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">A draft test case is a test case that has been created but has not yet been reviewed or approved publicly in an Organization. It is a work in progress and may be subject to changes before it is finalized. Draft test cases are usually created during the test planning phase and are used to capture initial ideas and thoughts about what needs to be tested. Once the draft test case has been reviewed and approved, it can be further developed, refined, and executed as part of the testing process.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">A draft test case is also distinguished from a published test case based on the prefix in the URL (<code className="ph codeph">draft-{'{'}testCaseID-testCaseName{'}'}</code>:</p>
