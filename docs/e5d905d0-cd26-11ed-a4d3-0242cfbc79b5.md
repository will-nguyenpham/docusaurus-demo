<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">A defect is an error in the software that prevents the intended action from completing, making it the tester's most important task to find them. Software defects can be present at any stage of the software development process, so it's crucial to identify and take appropriate action.</p> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Defects Report provides traceability and actionable insights to users, such as the defects' assignee, effort, status, priority, the day created, and the defects trendline for overall visibility.</p>
