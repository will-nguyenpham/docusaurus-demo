<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Desired capabilities are key/value pairs that tell the browser   properties such as browser name, browser version, and the path of   the browser driver in the system to determine the browsers'   behaviors at runtime. Desired capabilities which can be used to   configure such additional driver instances as FirefoxDriver,   ChromeDriver, InternetExplorerDriver, Selenium WebDriver are useful   in the following cases:</p> 
<ul xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="ul"><li className="li">Setting the browser and device properties in mobile     testing.</li><li className="li">Adding extra settings to browsers in web testing.</li></ul> 
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Katalon Studio allows you to define these desired capabilities   in different environments for a Katalon project   in <strong className="ph b">Project &gt; Settings &gt; Desired     Capabilities</strong>.</p> 
    

## <a id="id_1" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Supported environments for desired capabilities settings

    
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">In each selected environment, you can add, delete or clear   (delete all) desired capabilities settings. To learn more about   configuring desired capabilities for different testing environment,   you can refer to the following documents:</p>

## <a id="id_2" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Manage desired capabilities

    
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">From version 8.0.0 onwards, you can reuse desired capabilities   across Katalon Studio projects by importing and exporting desired   capabilities in a JSON file. To learn more about reusing desired   capabilities across projects, you can refer to this document: <a className="xref" href="/docs/create-tests/manage-projects/project-settings/desired-capabilities/manage-desired-capabilities-in-katalon-studio">Reuse     desired capabilities across projects</a>.</p> 
    
  
    

## <a id="id_3" class="anchor_top_offset"/>Use desired capabilities in Katalon projects

    
      
<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" className="p">Desired capabilities can be configured to customize your testing   environment, you can refer to the following tutorials for better   guidance:</p>
